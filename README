cygwin-crashreporter

A simple breakpad crashreporter for Cygwin.

By design, this is not a Cygwin application.  If there is a failure mode which
affects all Cygwin applications on a particular host, we still want to be able
to report the crash.

This can be invoked using Cygwin's error_start JIT facility. (e.g.
CYGWIN='"error_start=C:\cygwin\bin\cygwin-crashreporter-gui -r -k"')

Or, it could be invoked from a signal handler for SIGSEGV, SIGABORT etc.

Invoking the crashreporter like that isn't quite ideal as we don't capture the
EXCEPTION_POINTERS exception record into the minidump, so the minidump doesn't
record exactly which thread crashed, and with what exception.

Addressing these shortcomings requires a change in the Cygwin DLL to give it a
better way of invoking the crashreporter, passing that information.

The cygwin-crashreporter-hooks DLL is designed to be optionally dynamically
loaded by a cygwin application (or perhaps one day, the cygwin DLL), and
contains functions to be invoked at process creation (to ensure a crash
generation server is running), and at exception time (to request a crashdump)
