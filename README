cygwin-crashreporter

A simple breakpad crashreporter for Cygwin.

By design, this is not a Cygwin application

This can be invoked using Cygwin's error_start JIT facility, or from a SIGSEGV
handler to upload minidumps.

This isn't quite ideal as we don't capture the EXCEPTION_POINTERS exception
record into the minidump, but to do that will require some change to the cygwin
DLL.
