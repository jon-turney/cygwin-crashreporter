check for unused stuff in propsheet 'framework'
audit for error handling

CrashReportSender::SendCrashReport() doesn't take a timeout parameter: is the system default (which appears to be ~30s?)
usable? or will this cause most uploads to timeout?  If the dmp files we generate are typically 400K, to upload in 30s
requires ~100Kbps, somewhat faster than modem speeds...

Should file be removed on upload fail?

crash-generation-server:
Need some way to customize the minidump type used
Hangs around until WM_ENDSESSION.  Maybe we should arrange to terminate it when last cygwin process terminates?

CrashGenerationClient::kWaitForServerTimeoutMs is 15s, the client's timeout for
the server to process a dump request.  At the moment we assume that has been
disabled to allow for the GUI process to ask the user if we want to dump or not.
Perhaps things need to be rearranged so we always dump, then ask the user if
they want to upload?
