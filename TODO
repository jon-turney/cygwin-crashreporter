check for unused stuff in propsheet 'framework'
audit for error handling

Upload logfiles as well (requires a breakpad change to CrashReportSender::SendCrashReport to take a vector of files)

CrashReportSender::SendCrashReport() doesn't take a timeout parameter: is the system default (which appears to be ~30s?)
usable? or will this cause most uploads to timeout?  If the dmp files we generate are typically 400K, to upload in 30s
requires ~100Kbps, somewhat faster than modem speeds...

Should file be removed on upload fail?
