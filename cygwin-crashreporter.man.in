.SH NAME
cygwin-crashreporter \- A crash reporting tool for cygwin

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cygwin-crashreporter-cli [OPTIONS] IGNORED_FILENAME WIN32PID

.B cygwin-crashreporter-gui [OPTIONS] IGNORED_FILENAME WIN32PID

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIcygwin-crashreporter\fP is crash reporting tool for Cygwin, which creates a
minidump of the specified process and uploads it to a reporting server.

\fIcygwin-crashreporter\fP can be used with Cygwin's JIT debugging facility in
exactly the same way as \fIdumper(1)\fP.

For compatibility with \fIdumper(1)\fP, a filename argument must be provided
which is ignored, and the target process is terminated unless the -n option is
given.

.SH OPTIONS
\fIcygwin-crashreporter\fP accepts the following optional command line switches:

.TP 8
.B \-d

.B \-h
List these options and exit.
.TP 8
.B \-n

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.B CYGWIN_CRASHREPORTER_URL
Sets the URL that the crash reporter will submit reports to.
.B CYGWIN_CRASHREPORTER_NO_DELETE_DUMP

server. Minidumps are placed in a subdirectory of the directory returned
by GetTempPath().

the breakpad library which does the actual work of creating a minidump and
uploading it to a crash reporting server.
